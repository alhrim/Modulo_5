Project 1 focuses on developing and disseminating a comprehensive R Markdown report, specifically a weather check article and accompanying presentation slides. The project involves creating these documents in RStudio, converting them to HTML format, and then publishing them online using platforms like RPubs and GitHub Pages. This process ensures that the final outputs are easily accessible and shareable, allowing others to view and utilize the work directly from the internet. Through this project, you gain hands-on experience in data visualization, report generation, and online dissemination using widely adopted tools in the data science community.
